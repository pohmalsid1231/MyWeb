        <p>I'm a guy of focus, firstly I focus on something and then I will analyse and summarise everything with myself and after that I make a speech. I started coding & semi hacking when I was 15 years old.</p>
        <p>I'm Good in Html & CSS and also I have knowledge about some other important programming languages too. I always told and advised my friends to learn and study the field that they are good at. I dont want my friends to be forced by their parents to learn something else. </p>
        <br><p>I Love You all!!!!!</p>
